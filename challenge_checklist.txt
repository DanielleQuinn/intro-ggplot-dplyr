Capstone Challenge:

Creating a list of tasks that will need to be completed to reproduce a figure is a great way of keeping track
of your progress and helps you identify which tasks you will need to use resources like R Cookbook or
the ggplot2 Cheat Sheet. These tasks are listed, generally, in increasing difficulty. As you complete a task,
add a "+" sign next to it on the Etherpad. If you can't quite figure out  task, move on to the next one, or 
discuss it with your neighbour. As I see "+" added to each task, we will pause and I'll ask someone to add the
code to the Etherpad and explain how it works.

(a) Subset data to only include 2007
(b) Boxplot of life expectancy and continent
(c) Update axes labels
(d) Use black and white theme
(e) Add points overlaying boxplots
(f) Points are "jittered" across a set width (i.e. no in a stright vertical line)
(g) Points are triangles
(h) Points are coloured by GDP per capita
(i) Low values are red, high values are green
(j) Legend title is GDP per Capita
(k) Plot title is Life Expectancy and Gross Domestic Product in 2007
(l) Export the plot
