###SubSubheader

This is text not code. You can modify your text using standard symbols. For example to make something **bold**,
*italic*, etc.

How do we add code?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
a <- 1:10
df <- data.frame(col1 = 1:10, col2 = 10:1)
ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(x = col1, y = col2))
```

What if we want to know the average value of a?

The average of a is `r mean(a)`.

To find this value, I used the `mean` function in R.

To learn more about this function, go [Google](https://www.google.com) it.
